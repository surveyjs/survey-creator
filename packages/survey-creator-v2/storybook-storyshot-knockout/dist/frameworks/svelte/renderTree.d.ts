/**
 * Provides functionality to convert your raw story to the resulting markup.
 *
 * Storybook snapshots need the rendered markup that svelte outputs,
 * but since we only have the story config data ({ Component, data }) in
 * the Svelte stories, we need to mount the component, and then return the
 * resulting HTML.
 *
 * If we don't render to HTML, we will get a snapshot of the raw story
 * i.e. ({ Component, data }).
