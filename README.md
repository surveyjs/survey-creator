Survey Creator is a GUI-based no-code form builder library that allows easy drag-and-drop form creation even for non-technical users. The form buider produces a survey configuration in JSON format. This configuration can be later used by the [SurveyJS Library](https://github.com/surveyjs/survey-library) to display a survey form in your application. You can try out our [free survey tool](https://surveyjs.io/create-free-survey) built to demonstrate the capabilities of the Survey Creator library and estimate its potential value for your project(s).
