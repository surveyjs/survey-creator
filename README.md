The Survey Creator is a visual survey designer / form builder for [SurveyJS](https://github.com/surveyjs/survey-library).

Two Survey Creator versions are available. Both versions can be used in jQuery, Knockout, Angular, Vue, and React applications. Differences between them are described in the following help topic: [SurveyJS Creator V2: What's new](https://surveyjs.io/Documentation/Survey-Creator?id=Creator-V2-Whats-New).

## Survey Creator V1

Survey Creator V1 is the latest RTM version. It is powered by Knockout. You can find its sources in the [survey-creator](./packages/survey-creator) directory.

## Survey Creator V2

Survey Creator V2 is a successor of V1. It has an updated design and separates survey model from the UI.

V2 is also planned to be independent from Knockout. [React version](./packages/survey-creator-react) does not require Knockout already. Versions for other frameworks are scheduled for development. Until then, you can use the [Knockout version](./packages/survey-creator-knockout) with any framework.
