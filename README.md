# SurveyJS Creator

</div>

<div align="justify">

SurveyJS Creator is an extensible client-side form builder component that seamlessly integrates with any backend system and allows you to build dynamic JSON-based forms right in your JavaScript application.
It features a drag-and-drop UI, CSS Theme Editor, and GUI for conditional logic and form branching. Each form created in a no-code form builder UI has a JSON definition (schema) generated behind the scenes. Such schema contains form configurations, including its style, contents, layout, and behavior in response to user interactions, such as data submission, input validation, error messages, etc. You can export a form to JSON, save it to your database and render in your application using [SurveyJS Form Library](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/overview). SurveyJS Creator has **native support for React, Angular, Vue, and Knockout;** jQuery is supported via a wrapper over the Knockout version. The form builder UI is fully customizable and can be modified to meet any functional and brand requirements.
