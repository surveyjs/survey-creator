# Numbering within a Form

## About Numbering within a Form

Numbering refers to the sequential labeling of elements within your survey or form, such as pages, panels, and questions. Clear numbering within a form can improve clarity and navigation, help users keep track of their progress, and enhance the overall organization of the survey. However, there are situations when removing numbers can create a cleaner, less cluttered appearance. This guide will provide you with detailed instructions on how to manage numbering in your survey effectively, ensuring you achieve your specific needs.

## How to Remove Question Numbering

### For All Questions

By default, each new question added to your form is assigned a number. If you prefer not to number any questions throughout the form, you can easily disable this feature:

1. Switch to the survey-level settings in the form tree.  
2. Under **Question settings**, locate the **Question numbering** setting.  
3. Select the **No numbering** option from the drop-down menu.

### For an Individual Question

If you want to keep question numbering for most questions but remove it from specific ones, follow these steps:

1. Select the question for which you want to remove the number.  
2. Under **Layout**, locate the **Hide the question number** setting.  
3. Check the box to remove the question number.

## How to Restart Question Numbering on Each Page

If you would like the question numbering to reset at the beginning of each page, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Switch to the survey-level settings.  
2. Under **Question settings**, locate the **Question numbering** setting.  
3. Select the **Reset on each page** option from the drop-down menu.

Page numbers in your survey or form are hidden by default. To display them, follow these steps:

1. Switch to the survey-level settings.  
2. Under **Pages**, locate the **Show page numbers** setting.  
3. Check the box to enable page numbering.

## How to Number Panels

Panel numbering can be enabled for each individual panel, but only if the question numbering setting at the survey level is set to either **Auto-numbering** or **Reset on each page**. If the **No numbering** option is selected, panel numbering will not be applicable. To number a panel, follow these steps:

1. Select the panel you want to number using the survey tree or by clicking it on the design surface.  
2. Under **Numbering**, locate the **Number panels** setting.
3. Check the box to number the selected panel.

## Question Numbering within a Panel

You can manage question numbering within an individual panel. For instance, you can number the panel itself but remove the numbering from the questions inside as follows:

1. Select the panel whose numbering you want to adjust.
2. Under **Numbering**, locate the **Question numbering** setting. 
3. Select the **No numbering** option from the drop-down menu.
