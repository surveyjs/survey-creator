# Survey Creator / Form Builder Overview

Survey Creator / Form Builder is a visual designer that allows users to create surveys and forms. The designer produces a survey configuration in JSON format. This configuration can be later used by the [SurveyJS Form Library](/Documentation/Library) to display a survey or form in your application.
