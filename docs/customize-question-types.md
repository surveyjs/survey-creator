# Customize Question Types

To customize question types, you need to make changes to Form Library as well as to Survey Creator. Below are the available customization options with links to relevant Form Library help topics:

- [Add custom properties to question types](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/add-custom-properties-to-a-form)\
Extend the functionality of built-in question types by adding custom properties.

- [Create specialized question types](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/create-specialized-question-types)\
Define new question types by preconfiguring properties of existing built-in types.

- [Create composite question types](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/create-composite-question-types)\
Combine multiple questions into a single, reusable, and preconfigured question block.

- Integrate third-party components in [Angular](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/third-party-component-integration-angular), [React](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/third-party-component-integration-react), and [Vue 3](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/customize-question-types/third-party-component-integration-vue)\
Enhance your forms by embedding third-party UI components into SurveyJS questions.
